# PasswordChecker
In this small applicaton i had done password checker where it can check how many times your password has been hacked. I have done it with the help of webiste named "Have i been pwned" where it check for the how many times your password is been hacked. Following are steps to run code.


Step to Run this code 
 .Step-1 Either download the code or clone the .py file.
 .Step-2 You need to run .py file in the terminal
 .Step-3 Suppose you are running on python3 
     you can run this -  python3 "filename that you saved" Hello. 
          Hello is the password you need give the password along running file
          
I am looking forward to imporve this code by reading the password from text files insted of terminal
Because when you type password in terminal your password will save in computer we access it by easily by pressing UP Arrow. To overcome this i am trying to read passsword from .txt file 

THANK YOU
