# PasswordChecker
In this project i have created the password checker i had taken passwords from wobsite called "Have i been pwned" 
Step to Run this code 
Step-1 first you need to clone this code 
Step-2 you have to run this in terminal 
Step-3 Suppose you are running on python3 
     you can run this -  python3 "filename that you saved" Hello 
          Hello is the password you need give the password along running file
          
I am looking forward to imporve this code by reading the password from text files insted of terminal
Because when you typr password in terminal your password will save in computer we access it by easily by pressing UP Arrow. To overcome this i am trying to read passsword from .txt file 

THANK YOU
